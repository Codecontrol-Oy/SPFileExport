# SharePoint ContentDB file exporter

* Tool for extracting files updated through SharePoint
* Tested with SP 2010

Note: Tool only exports the latest version of every file

Exports files inside content db to the solution directory:

```
/files/folder/filename
/files/folder2/filename2
/files/folder2/filename3
/files/folder3/filename4
```

After all files have been exported, a filelist.txt is created to see all exported files.
